# phaseField

Keep all .m files in the same folder, use 'main.m' to run 
this program. The original program was run on Matlab 2015a,
but any version after it should also work. 

Before submitting the job, you need to set parameters for
`nu0` and `etam0` by replacing `VIS_PARA` and `CONTR_PARA`
in `main.m` with valid float values.

The output will be in `contra_{}_fric_{}.dat` where {} will
be the parameter values you input in `main.m`, more detailed
simulation results will be in folders named `Data` and 
`Figures` generated by the program.

Please note this is a stochastic simulation, the output may
not be exactly the same even if you use the same parameters.
To repeat a simulation, you can keep the random number seed 
unchanged.
